                <h2>EU Online Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>
                    The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR):
                    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a>.
                    We are neither obliged nor willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.

                <h2>Liability for Contents</h2>
                <p>
                    As a service provider we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 TMG.
                    Pursuant to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored foreign information
                    or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
                    Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
                    A liability in this regard, however, is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement.
                    Upon notification of such violations we will remove the content immediately.

                <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Our offering contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence.
                    Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
                    The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.
                    The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
                    Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
                    However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable
                    without concrete evidence of a violation of the law.
                    If we become aware of any violations, we will remove such links immediately.
