# yourMoment

AI-powered monitoring and comment automation platform for the myMoment writing community. Automates article discovery, generates context-aware LLM-generated comments, and manages multiple monitoring workflows.

This software project was developed as [part of the DEEP myMoment research and development project](https://deep-consortium.ch/en/project/deep-mymoment) which itself is a member of the [DEEP research consortium](https://deep-consortium.ch/en/about) that focuses on foundations, challenges, and consequences of digital learning in Swiss primary schools. The development lead was located at [St.Gallen University of teacher education](https://www.phsg.ch/de/forschung-entwicklung/projekte/deep-digital-literacy-participation-writing-platform-mymoment).

[This is also my personal learning project for LLM-driven software engineering tools like Claude Code, spec-kit and alike.]

## Overview

yourMoment enables teachers and researchers to monitor myMoment articles and automatically generate LLM-powered comments using their preferred LLM providers (like OpenAI or Mistral). The platform handles authenticated scraping, comment generation with customizable prompts, and process orchestration through a simple web interface.

## Key Features

- **Multi-user architecture** – Isolated workflows with per-user LLM configurations, credentials, and templates
- **Basic security** – JWT authentication, Fernet encryption for sensitive data and configurable password policies
- **LLM provider flexibility** – Support for OpenAI, Mistral. Other providers will be available in the future.
- **Customizable templates** – System and user-defined prompt templates with validation and required AI disclosure prefix
- **Automated monitoring** – Background processes with configurable duration limits, multi-credential fan-out, and (hopefully) graceful shutdown
- **Article management** – Comprehensive article browsing with category (leaning tasks in myMoment) and tag (classroom in myMoment) filtering
- **Somewhat Production-ready** – Type-safe configuration, health checks and logging

See `AGENTS.md` for the condensed architecture brief used by AI assistants.

## Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| API & services | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Alembic |
| Background jobs | Celery 5 + Redis broker/result store |
| Scraping | aiohttp, BeautifulSoup4 |
| LLM integration | instructor library |
| UI | Jinja2 templates, Bootstrap 5, vanilla JS (fetch) |
| Storage | SQLite by default (PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Redis (optional, required for background workers)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup virtual environment (recommeded)
git clone <repo>
cd yourMoment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration (see Configuration section)

# Initialize database and seed development data
python cli.py db migrate
python cli.py db seed  # Creates system templates + test user in development

# Start development server
python cli.py server
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (UI) and `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs` (API docs).

**Development test credentials:**
- Email: `test@yourmoment.dev`
- Password: `Valid!Password123`

**Note:** The seed command is environment-aware. In production (`ENVIRONMENT=production`), it only creates system templates and prompts you to use `python cli.py user create` for secure user creation. This is mandatory since user creation with email validation is not implemted in yourMoment right now.

### Background Workers (Optional)

For automated monitoring processes, start Celery workers:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Worker
python cli.py worker

# Terminal 2: Beat scheduler
python cli.py scheduler
```

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Generate secure keys:
   ```bash
   # Application secret key
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

   # JWT secret
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

   # Fernet encryption key
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```

3. Edit `.env` with your configuration values

### Critical Settings

**Security (Required for Production)**
- `SECRET_KEY` – Application secret (auto-validated in production)
- `JWT_SECRET` – JWT token signing key
- `YOURMOMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` – Fernet key for encrypting credentials/API keys

**Database**
- `DB_SQLITE_FILE` – Database file path (default: `yourmoment.db`)

**Celery (Optional)**
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL` – Redis broker URL (required for background workers)
- `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` – Redis result backend URL

**Environment Control**
- `ENVIRONMENT` – Set to `production`, `development`, or `testing`

### Environment-Specific Behavior

The application automatically adjusts defaults based on `ENVIRONMENT`:

| Setting | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Logging | Verbose (DEBUG) | Structured (INFO) |
| Security | Relaxed | Strict validation |
| Encryption | Auto-generated | Required explicit keys |
| Database | Local SQLite | Configurable path |

### Configuration API

Access settings type-safely throughout the application:

```python
from src.config.settings import get_settings

settings = get_settings()
db_file = settings.database.DB_SQLITE_FILE
is_prod = settings.is_production
```

See `.env.example` for complete configuration reference.

## Testing

### Test Suites

The test suite 

**Unit Tests** – Isolated component testing:
```bash
pytest tests/unit -q
```

**Contract Tests** – API endpoint validation with full app bootstrap:
```bash
pytest tests/contract -q
```

**Integration Tests** – Multi-step workflows (may require Celery):
```bash
pytest tests/integration -q
```

**Performance Tests** – External endpoints testing (myMoment platform, LLM poviders):
```bash
pytest tests/performance -q
```


### Test Configuration

Tests use isolated configuration:
- Separate SQLite database (`yourMoment_testing.db`)
- Dedicated Redis database (db 1)
- Test-specific encryption keys
- Minimal logging output

Set `ENVIRONMENT=testing` for test-specific behavior.

## Management CLI

yourMoment includes a unified `cli.py` script for all management operations. See [CLI.md](./CLI.md) for complete documentation.

**Common commands:**
```bash
# Server management
python cli.py server                    # Start web server
python cli.py worker                    # Start Celery worker
python cli.py scheduler                 # Start beat scheduler

# Database operations
python cli.py db migrate                # Run migrations
python cli.py db seed                   # Seed test data
python cli.py db stats                  # Show statistics
python cli.py db reset                  # Reset database (⚠️ destructive)

# User management
python cli.py user create               # Create new user

# Celery monitoring
python cli.py celery info               # Show configuration
python cli.py celery health             # Check health
python cli.py celery clear              # Clear queues
```

## Production Considerations

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Generate and set strong `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `YOURMOMENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CORS_ORIGINS` for your domain
- [ ] Review password policy settings (min length, complexity requirements)
- [ ] Enable audit logging and configure log retention
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all external connections
- [ ] Secure Redis instance with authentication (if exposed)
- [ ] Set appropriate `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` for your use case

### Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Web server (use --workers for multi-process)
ENVIRONMENT=production python cli.py server --workers 4

# 2. Celery workers (multiple instances for scalability)
python cli.py worker --concurrency 4

# 3. Beat scheduler (single instance only)
python cli.py scheduler
```

See [CLI.md](./CLI.md) for systemd service examples configuration.
